#  Smart Waste Detection using Tello Drone + YOLO  

##  Project Overview  
This project uses a **Tello drone** equipped with an **HD camera** and an **AI-powered object detection model (YOLO)** to detect and count waste in public areas.  
 

## Project Background  
This project was developed as part of a **training program organized by The Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity, Programming and Drones**, hosted at **Tuwaiq Academy**.  

- It was a **team project**, created collaboratively in just **4 days**.  
- The focus was to integrate **drones and AI** for environmental applications.  
- For training the YOLO model, we used **pre-collected datasets from Roboflow**, a platform for image dataset management and labeling.
